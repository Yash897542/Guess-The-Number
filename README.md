# Guess-The-Number
Console Based Project on Guess The Number
# C++ Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²

A classic "Guess the Number" game built in C++ that runs in your console. The computer thinks of a number, and you have to guess it!

This project is a great example of core C++ programming, demonstrating random number generation, user input handling, loops, and conditional logic.

## Features
-   **Random Number Generation:** The computer picks a new random number between 1 and 100 for every game.
-   **User-Friendly Feedback:** The game tells you if your guess is "Too high" or "Too low".
-   **Attempt Counter:** Tracks how many guesses it took you to find the number.
-   **Input Validation:** Gracefully handles non-numeric inputs.
-   **Play Again:** Asks you if you want to play another round after each game.
